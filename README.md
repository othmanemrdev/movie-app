# movie-app
The goal of this project is to create a mobile app for movie enthusiasts to discover and explore popular movies. The app will utilize the TMDB API to display a list of popular movies, allow users to search for movies by keyword, and provide detailed information about each movie, such as the description, rating, release date, and actors.
